This is a small project experimenting with setting up ESLint.

## How to use

- see `.ellintrc.json` for basic syntax of ESLint config file
- see `index.js` for var-instead-of-const error
- `eslint *.js` to find errors
- `eslint --fix *.js` to automatically fix errors
- also in VSCode, install "ESLint" extension which will show errors live and allow you to fix them immediately
